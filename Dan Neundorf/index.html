		<a href="#go-top"  class="content-heading" id="Virtual-Workshop-Design"><h4>Virtual Workshop Design</h4></a>
		<p>When designing an engaging virtual workshop consider the following principles:</p>
		<strong>Principle 1: What is your purpose?</strong>
		<p>Start with the end in mind. Ask yourself, "What do I want my participants to think, feel, and do because of this virtual workshop?" Work backward from this endpoint, ensuring every single piece of content, process, activity, action, interaction, slide, click, and question moves participants closer to that outcome. If it doesn't do that, leave it out.</p>
		<strong>Principle 2: It's not about you—it's all about them</strong>
		<p><i>Engage early: </i>“It’s easy to get people’s attention. But what counts is getting their interest.” In a world of diminishing attention spans, you must get the attention and interest of participants right away. I always begin with exercises that encourage participant interactions across the group. It signals that they will play an active and important role throughout the event
		</p>
		<p>
		Want to keep learners engaged? Then remember that the star of the show is each individual participant. Stop asking yourself, "What do I want to say?" and replace that with, "What do participants need to hear?"
		</p>

		<p>
		If you think about your workshops from the learners' point of view, you can personalize them by working out what activities, stories, and content will resonate with participants. They are much more likely to stay engaged if the story is about them.
		</p>
		<p>To do this, try these techniques:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use a short survey prior to the class to find out the group's most-pressing areas of need.</li>
			<li>Ask participants to share their own examples during the workshop for the group to discuss and work on together.</li>
			<li>Direct participants to work on their own scenarios with colleagues through virtual breakout sessions.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Design prepared questions and activities into your slides that will help participants drive deeper thinking about their own situations. For example, one slide may say, "Share one example of how you will apply tactic X in your team."</p>
		<strong>Principle 3: We’re in this together</strong>
		<p>How can we access learners' ideas and experiences? First, set up-front expectations for the participants' responsibility in contributing. Then, fill your workshop with activities that make contributing easy. </p>
		<p>Here are a few ideas for encouraging peer-to-peer interaction:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Introduce participants to each other as they log in to your workshop. Then they will often naturally chat with each other.</li>
			<li>Introduce the idea of a wingman, or a participant who is tasked with listening to a peer and asking an insightful question.</li>
			<li>Give participants the power to decide who speaks next by passing the baton (even if it's imaginary) to a participant.</li>
			<li>Encourage peer-to-peer coaching by splitting learners into breakout groups.</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Principle 4: Safe Hands</strong>
		<p>Welcome participants into the workshop in a way that instantly puts them at ease and makes them feel comfortable with you, the group, and the virtual environment.</p>
		<p>Much of this comes down to your confidence, but you can build some aspects into the workshop that will help participants understand that they are in safe hands. </p>
		<p>Here are a few:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Set the tone for an upbeat, interactive workshop with simple and friendly workshop communications and invitations.</li>
			<li>Create a document with simple steps for overcoming common technical or audio problems that you can copy and paste into the chat box if someone is struggling.</li>
			<li>Share a slide with screenshots of what participants will see on their monitors. Then you can point out the different functions and how to use each.</li>
			<li>Build references for any science or research you use into the slide deck so participants can look these up later.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The workshop really starts before it starts. Preworkshop communications, logging in, and welcoming participants should all happen before the official workshop begins. These first impressions are the perfect opportunity for you to put participants at ease and for them to feel good about the process.</p>
		<strong>Principle 5: Sequencing</strong>
		<p>Unlike in face-to-face training programs, you can't just fly through content by the seat of your pants with a flipchart, pens, and sticky notes in a virtual environment. From the beginning to the end, each section needs to follow a logical route with clear links between steps or concepts. To accomplish this and prevent learners from becoming disengaged, ask yourself:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>What are the key messages?</li>
			<li>What links each section together?</li>
			<li>What are the key questions to ask at each stage?</li>
			<li>What is the route map for the workshop?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>While answering these questions and integrating your responses into your slide deck, keep in mind that timing is critical. Build clear timing into your delivery plan, remembering that most things take a little longer to do in a virtual workshop than in face-to-face settings. A slow start, detailed question, or tech problem can derail a virtual workshop. Make sure you have a plan B in case timing becomes squeezed, including alternative exercises and discussions so the workshop never feels rushed.</p>
		<strong>Principle 6: Sizzle</strong>
		<p>Put the sizzle on your sausage. Flair is how the virtual trainer brings her personality to the session and manages participant energy. So, how can you influence this in a virtual workshop?</p>
		<p>Participants often attend virtual workshops expecting them to be one-way lectures or noninteractive sessions. "Maybe I'll have an opportunity to catch up on emails while some virtual trainer lectures on in the background," they think.</p>
		<p>Grab participants' attention and demonstrate, rather than tell, how your session will be different, more engaging, interactive, and upbeat than they might expect. Build in interaction as soon as possible by launching a poll, sharing an idea in chat, or clicking an emoji. Have group members speak as soon as they enter the virtual workshop. Build a slide with a shock statistic, thought-provoking question, or list of challenges.</p>
		<p>You also should have participants interact in some way every couple of minutes, varying the types of activities to involve participants in different ways. Mix it up with real-life scenarios, whiteboards, posters, polls, breakouts, peer coaching, quizzes, gamification, paired interviews, and video—but always with purpose. Remember, if it doesn't move the participants closer to achieving the purpose of the workshop, then it shouldn't make the cut.</p>

		<a href="#go-top" class="content-heading" id="10-Adult-Learning-Principles"><h4>10 Adult Learning Principles</h4></a>
		<p>Here are 10 Adult Learning Principles that will help guide your virtual workshop design:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Adults must have a reason to learn</li>
			<li>Adults must be involved in the learning</li>
			<li>Adults learn by building on experience</li>
			<li>Adults learn by doing</li>
			<li>Adults learn in different ways and at different rates. Adults need a variety of methods</li>
			<li>Adults need a meaningful workshop</li>
			<li>Adults need a safe environment</li>
			<li>Adults appreciate constructive and helpful feedback</li>
			<li>Adults appreciate an informal environment</li>
			<li>Adults appreciate being treated with dignity and respect</li>
		</ul>

		<a href="#go-top" class="content-heading" id="Tips-for-Slides"><h4>Tips for Slides for Virtual Workshops</h4></a>
		<p><b>Less is more and more is less. </b>Prepare many more slides than you would for a face-to-face workshop but with much less on each slide. There is no golden rule regarding how many slides—just keep it moving and changing.</p>
		<p><b>Bullets are boring. </b>Don't put whole sentences on your slides and just read them out (unless it is a direct quote). Mix it up with images, SmartArt, charts, and infographics.</p>
		<p><b>Stick to a theme. </b>Choose a font and a color palette and stick to it. Decide on a look for your images so they follow a theme too. For example, you might consider using all black-and-white photos, all illustrations, all business-based images, or all nature pictures.</p>
		<p><b>State the obvious. </b>Give key messages, links between sections, and questions their own slides so participants know this is important information they need to pay attention to.</p>
		<p><b>Create an ABC for process. </b>Create a slide with step-by-step instructions for any activities you want participants to follow or actions you want them to take. This way, what they need to do is always clear.</p>
		<p><b>Ditch the slide number. </b>Don't tell your participants that this is slide 13 of 38. This lets you omit slides if time is tight without participants thinking they may be missing out.</p>
		<p><b>Get help. </b>Find the individuals around you who are great at creating slide decks and use them. Most people are willing to share tips and best practices.</p>
		<p><b>Have fun. </b>Be playful with your quotes and images. Keep it current, fresh, and up-to-date.</p>

		<p><b>Feedback Form</b> (Phase 1):</p>
		<p><span class="underline"> Team Member Perceptions</span> (Phase 1a)<br>
		Team Member is queried in a way that reveals insights related to learning effectiveness. 
		Examples: Measures that target Team Member Comprehension, Realistic Practice, Team Member Motivation to Apply, After-Learning Support, etc. <br>
		<i>Such measures can hint at outcomes but should be augmented with objective outcome measures (Phases 2 -5)</i>
		</p>
		<p>
		<p><span class="underline"> Knowledge</span> (Phase 1b)<br>
		Team Member answers questions about facts/terminology.<br>
		Knowledge Recitation—during or right after learning event.<br>
		<i>Usually inadequate because knowing terminology does not fully enable performance. 
		Knowledge Retention</i>—after several days or more.<br>
		<i>Usually inadequate because remembering terminology does not fully enable performance. </i>
		</p>
		<p>
		<p><span class="underline">Decision Making Competence </span> (Phase 2)<br>
		Team Member makes decisions given relevant realistic scenarios<br>
		Decision Making Competence—during or right after learning event.<br>
		<i>Not a fully adequate metric because Team Members may forget decision making competencies. </i><br>
		Remembered Decision Making Competence—after several days or more.<i>ADEQUATE TO CERTIFY DECISION MAKING COMPETENCE. </i>

		<p><span class="underline">Task Competence </span> (Phase 3)<br>
		Team Member performs relevant realistic actions and decision making. <br>
		Task Competence—during or right after learning event.<br>
		<i>Not a fully adequate metric because Team Members may forget their task competencies. </i><br>
		Remembered Task Competence—after several days or more. <i> ADEQUATE TO CERTIFY TASK COMPETENCE.</i> <br>
		<i>NOTE: “Tasks” comprise both decision making and action taking.</i>
		</p>
		<p><span class="underline">Learning Transfer</span>  (Phase 4)<br>
		When Team Member uses what was learned to perform work tasks successfully— as clearly demonstrated through objective measures. <br>
		Assisted Transfer—when performance is substantially prompted/supported.<i> ADEQUATE TO CERTIFY ASSISTED TRANSFER.</i> <br>
		Full Transfer—when Team Member demonstrates full agency in applying the learning. <i>ADEQUATE TO CERTIFY FULL TRANSFER.</i><br>

		<a href="#go-top" class="content-heading"><h4>Guidelines for Feedback Forms</h4></a>
		<ul>
			<li>Remind participants of the content and the learning experience to ensure they consider the full learning experience.</li>
			<li>Persuade participants to attend to feedback forms with full engagement.</li>
			<li>Ensure feedback forms are not too long and are not too short.</li>
			<li>Follow up with participants to let them know that the feedback results were reviewed and utilized in pull through activities.</li>
			<li>Use descriptive answer choices. Do not use numbers, fuzzy adjectives, or other vague wording.</li>
			<li>Avoid using affirmations in your questions.</li>
			<li>Use answer choices that have a balance between positive and negative responses.</li>
			<li>Use answer choices that offer the full range of choices that might be expected.</li>
			<li>Seek a measurement expert to check your question wording to help you avoid biases and unclear language.</li>
			<li>Never ask a question that you can’t or won’t be able to use to make an improvement.</li>
			<li>Don’t ask participants questions that they won’t be good at answering.</li>
			<li>Balance the length and precision of your answer choices—keeping the answers as short as possible, but lengthening them as needed to make them precise enough so that participants know what they mean.</li>
			<li>Provide delayed feedback forms in addition to in-the-learning feedback forms.</li>
			<li>Do not transform feedback forms results into numbers.</li>
			<li>Delineate standards of success and failure—acceptable results versus unacceptable results—in advance of training.</li>
			<li>Ensure your feedback forms measure factors that are aligned with science-of-learning recommendations, for example, the four pillars of training effectiveness: (1) understanding, (2) remembering, (3) motivation to apply, and (4) after-training supports.</li>
			<li>Design your feedback forms as opportunities to send stealth messages—messages that hint at good learning-design practices.</li>

		<strong>Think- Pair- Share (TPS)</strong>
		<p></p>
		<p>The TPS procedure: </p>
		<p>
			1. Give participants a question that requires them to solve a problem <br>
			2. Ask individuals to plan out the method step-by-step to solving the problem <br>
			3. Instruct participants to form groups of two or three to compare each other’s methods. <br>
			4. Let them discuss and make any necessary changes <br>
			5. Now, have them work together to actually solve the problem <br>
			6. Invite everyone back together as a large group and ask for volunteers or randomly <br>
			7. Choose a few pairs to give a brief summary of their answers<br>

			<tr>
				<td>Opening:</td>
				<td>
					<ul>
						<li>I remembered that a good opening should reference prior learning/life knowledge, engage and motivate my participants and explain the importance of the workshop. Story, images, metaphors, rhetorical questions, a video snippet, a joke, a comic, etc., can help me do this.</li>
						<li>I had a clear introduction to the topic.</li>
						<li>The purpose of the workshop was well-articulated.</li>
						<li>I referenced to prior knowledge/experience the participants should think about.</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Outcomes:</td>
				<td>
					<ul>
						<li>My outcomes were clear and SMART, using Bloom’s verbs to target domains and levels.</li>
						<li>I remembered not to use verbs like know, understand, realize and learn as these do not specifically target Bloom levels and domains.</li>
						<li>Outcomes were explicitly written and vocalized.</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Pre-Assess:</td>
				<td>
					<ul>
						<li>I discovered out what the participants were interested in?</li>
						<li>I  uncovered what the participants already knew.</li>
						<li>I adjusted the depth or pace of the workshop based on my pre-assessment discovery?</li>
						<li>I included a way for my learners to self-assess.</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Learning:</td>
				<td>
					<ul>
						<li>I remembered that to be learning-centred and not just a talking-head trainer, I need to include activities and tasks that allow participants to practice the content and construct their own understanding of it.</li>
						<li>My activities were directly linked to my outcomes.</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Post-Assess:</td>
				<td>
					<ul>
						<li>I remembered that I need to include a way of evaluating what the participants learned from my instruction to help me determine what I need to change about my training and motivate the participants to practice and demonstrate their knowledge and skills.</li>
						<li>My post-assessment was clearly linked to my outcomes.</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Summary:</td>
				<td>
					<ul>
						<li>I remembered that a good summary should encourage authentic practice, reemphasize the importance of the workshop and link to future learning.</li>
						<li>I revisited my outcomes.</li>
						<li>I summarized the major themes and concepts quickly.</li>
						<li>I reemphasized the workshop’s purpose.</li>
						<li>I linked to future authentic practice or future workshops.</li>
					</ul>
